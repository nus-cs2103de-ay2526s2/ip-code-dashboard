Java Streams API\nprovides a more declarative and functional approach to collection\nprocessing that improves code maintainability.\n\nLet\u0027s replace traditional loops with Stream operations in 8 methods across\n4 files, reducing code by ~26 lines while maintaining all functionality.\n\nStreams provide a more concise and expressive way to process collections.\nThe functional style separates the \"what\" from the \"how\", making code\neasier to understand and maintain.\n","fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":43,"deletions":69}}},{"hash":"3cbfd3b09f4bd7007f45bc4db2179ba6807762a1","isMergeCommit":true,"messageTitle":"Merge master into branch-A-Streams","messageBody":"","fileTypesAndContributionMap":{}},{"hash":"b88a8a0772e899e272adc6df69fc71af58ea67fc","isMergeCommit":true,"messageTitle":"Merge branch-A-Streams into master","messageBody":"The master branch currently uses traditional iteration patterns for\ncollection operations across TaskList, Storage, Ui, and CommandType\nclasses. These implementations rely on explicit loops and manual\niteration which can be verbose and harder to maintain.\n\nThere is a need to modernize the codebase by adopting Java Streams API.\nThe Streams API provides a more declarative and functional approach to\ncollection processing, improving code readability and maintainability.\n\nThis merge integrates the branch-A-Streams feature branch which refactors\neight methods across four files to use Java Streams API. The refactoring\nreplaces traditional for-loops with stream operations for filtering,\nmapping, and collecting operations.\n\nUsing Streams API improves code expressiveness and reduces boilerplate.\nThe functional style makes the code more concise and easier to understand.\nAll 123 unit tests pass, confirming that the refactoring maintains\ncorrectness while improving code quality.\n","tags":["A-Streams"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{}},{"hash":"9658d74576717faa24ca8af101546f4e67f4746b","isMergeCommit":false,"messageTitle":"Add remind command","messageBody":"Users have no way to view upcoming tasks and deadlines at a glance.\nThey must manually scan through the entire task list to identify\nwhich tasks require immediate attention.\n\nA reminder feature would help users prioritize their work by\ndisplaying tasks sorted by urgency.
