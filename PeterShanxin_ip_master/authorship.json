The experience showed that while AI can handle parallel workflows and conflict resolution, the overhead of merging outweighs the benefits for small increments. Time spent on conflict resolution negated any theoretical parallelism gains. External AI review tools (Codex, Copilot) were valuable for catching issues that human review might miss.","lastModifiedDate":"2026-02-05T20:10:25","isFullCredit":false},{"lineNumber":319,"author":{"gitId":"PeterShanxin"},"content":"","lastModifiedDate":"2026-02-12T00:09:59","isFullCredit":false},{"lineNumber":320,"author":{"gitId":"PeterShanxin"},"content":"#### A-CheckStyle: Checkstyle Integration","lastModifiedDate":"2026-02-12T00:09:59","isFullCredit":false},{"lineNumber":321,"author":{"gitId":"PeterShanxin"},"content":"","lastModifiedDate":"2026-02-12T00:09:59","isFullCredit":false},{"lineNumber":322,"author":{"gitId":"PeterShanxin"},"content":"- **What was attempted**: Integrate Checkstyle into Gradle build with SE-EDU coding standards configuration","lastModifiedDate":"2026-02-12T00:09:59","isFullCredit":false},{"lineNumber":323,"author":{"gitId":"PeterShanxin"},"content":"- **What worked**:","lastModifiedDate":"2026-02-12T00:09:59","isFullCredit":false},{"lineNumber":324,"author":{"gitId":"PeterShanxin"},"content":"  - Checkstyle plugin configured with custom rules (config/checkstyle/checkstyle.xml)","lastModifiedDate":"2026-02-12T00:09:59","isFullCredit":false},{"lineNumber":325,"author":{"gitId":"PeterShanxin"},"content":"  - Project import groups properly defined (monday.* and org.junit grouping)","lastModifiedDate":"2026-02-12T00:09:59","isFullCredit":false},{"lineNumber":326,"author":{"gitId":"PeterShanxin"},"content":"  - Suppressions for JUnit test naming conventions (MethodName check)","lastModifiedDate":"2026-02-12T00:09:59","isFullCredit":false},{"lineNumber":327,"author":{"gitId":"PeterShanxin"},"content":"  - Build task integrated with checkstyle validation","lastModifiedDate":"2026-02-12T00:09:59","isFullCredit":false},{"lineNumber":328,"author":{"gitId":"PeterShanxin"},"content":"  - Fixed pre-existing Level-9 parser bugs (find and cheer command routing)","lastModifiedDate":"2026-02-12T00:09:59","isFullCredit":false},{"lineNumber":329,"author":{"gitId":"PeterShanxin"},"content":"  - Fixed import order violations across codebase (12 files)","lastModifiedDate":"2026-02-12T00:09:59","isFullCredit":false},{"lineNumber":330,"author":{"gitId":"PeterShanxin"},"content":"- **What didn\u0027t work**:","lastModifiedDate":"2026-02-12T00:09:59","isFullCredit":false},{"lineNumber":331,"author":{"gitId":"PeterShanxin"},"content":"  - Model selection issues after claude code update (possibly GLM 4.5 instead of 4.7)","lastModifiedDate":"2026-02-12T00:09:59","isFullCredit":false},{"lineNumber":332,"author":{"gitId":"PeterShanxin"},"content":"  - Session less efficient than before, possibly due to long context","lastModifiedDate":"2026-02-12T00:09:59","isFullCredit":false},{"lineNumber":333,"author":{"gitId":"PeterShanxin"},"content":"  - Required significant debugging/undo/redo interactions","lastModifiedDate":"2026-02-12T00:09:59","isFullCredit":false},{"lineNumber":334,"author":{"gitId":"PeterShanxin"},"content":"- **Fixes applied**: Model toggling improved performance after correction to GLM 4.7","lastModifiedDate":"2026-02-12T00:09:59","isFullCredit":false},{"lineNumber":335,"author":{"gitId":"PeterShanxin"},"content":"- **Observations**: AI session inefficiency this time - model confusion and debugging overhead reduced time savings.
